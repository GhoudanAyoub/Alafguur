      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/SkMobileFont.ttf

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/image/app/
    - assets/image/app/2.0x/
    - assets/image/app/3.0x/
    - assets/image/common/
    - assets/image/common/2.0x/
    - assets/image/common/3.0x/
    - assets/image/installation_guide/
    - assets/image/login/
    - assets/image/login/2.0x/
    - assets/image/login/3.0x/
    - assets/image/edit/
    - assets/image/edit/2.0x/
    - assets/image/edit/3.0x/
    - assets/image/payment/
    - assets/image/payment/billing_gateways/
    - assets/sound/video_im/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
